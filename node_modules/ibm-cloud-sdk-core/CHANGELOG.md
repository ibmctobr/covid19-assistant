### Code Refactoring

* look for credentials file in working dir before home dir ([#46](https://github.com/IBM/node-sdk-core/issues/46)) ([c5556de](https://github.com/IBM/node-sdk-core/commit/c5556de))
* return detailed response as second callback argument ([#34](https://github.com/IBM/node-sdk-core/issues/34)) ([dc24154](https://github.com/IBM/node-sdk-core/commit/dc24154))


### Features

* add `setServiceUrl` method as a setter for the `serviceUrl` property ([#41](https://github.com/IBM/node-sdk-core/issues/41)) ([cfb188f](https://github.com/IBM/node-sdk-core/commit/cfb188f))

* implement new authenticators to handle sdk authentication ([#37](https://github.com/IBM/node-sdk-core/issues/37)) ([f876b6d](https://github.com/IBM/node-sdk-core/commit/f876b6d))
* refactor core to use Promises instead of callbacks ([#55](https://github.com/IBM/node-sdk-core/issues/55)) ([9ec8afd](https://github.com/IBM/node-sdk-core/commit/9ec8afd))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* None of the authenticators or request methods take callbacks as arguments anymore - they return Promises instead.
* Users that have credential files in both the working directory and the home directory will see a change in which one is used.
* The internal property `url` no longer exists on the `baseOptions` object, it has been renamed to `serviceUrl`
* The old style of passing credentials to the base service will no longer work. An Authenticator instance MUST be passed in to the base service constructor.
* token managers no longer support user access tokens. use BearerTokenAuthenticator instead
* The class names of the token managers have changed.
* `Icp4dTokenManagerV1` renamed to `Cp4dTokenManager`
* `IamTokenManagerV1` renamed to `IamTokenManager`
* `JwtTokenManagerV1` renamed to `JwtTokenManager`
* The public method `setAuthorizationInfo` is renamed to `setClientIdAndSecret`
* The response body is no longer the 2nd callback argument, the detailed response is. The body is located under the `result` property. The `data` property is removed.
* This SDK may no longer work with applications running on Node 6 or 8.
